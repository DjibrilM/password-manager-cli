# Password Management CLI

## Introduction

Welcome to the Password Management CLI! This project is designed to help users securely manage their passwords using symmetric encryption. Built with Node.js and the `crypto` module, this CLI tool leverages AES-256-OCB encryption to ensure the security and integrity of your passwords.

### How It Works

1. **Master Password Registration:** Users can register a master password. This master password is used to derive encryption keys.
2. **Child Password Generation:** From the master password, users can generate and manage child passwords securely. Each child password is encrypted using the AES-256-OCB encryption algorithm.

## Installation

To set up the Password Management CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the project is located.

2. **Link the Project:**
   Run the following command to link the project locally:
   ```bash
     npm link
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to link the project locally:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the CLI to manage your passwords. For more details on available commands and options, refer to the documentation provided with the CLI or run the command password-manager --help.
